# 👋 Hey, I'm Sameed!

🚀 An Aspiring AI/ML Engineer | 🧠 Self-Taught Python Developer | 🛠 Projects > Perfection

Fueled by raw curiosity, I’m turning ideas into code — one focused rep at a time. I build publicly, learn relentlessly, and document everything from day one.

No shortcuts. Just deep work, daily consistency, and unapologetic ambition.

🎯 “Show up daily. Stay curious. The rest will follow.”

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 📚 Learning Python & core programming concepts
- 🔨 Building mini-projects to practice problem-solving
- 🧠 Preparing for machine learning fundamentals

## 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Master Python basics
- 🧪 Learn NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- 🤖 Start ML with scikit-learn by September
- 💻 Build a clean GitHub portfolio
